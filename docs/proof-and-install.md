This is the shortest current repo-native path to:

- understand what Pluxx already proves
- install the released self-hosted plugin in your host of choice
- run the strongest current demos in the right order

## Canonical 10-Minute First Run

This is the one onboarding path new users should follow first:

`init --from-mcp` -> `doctor` -> `lint` -> `build --install` -> `verify-install`

Use one host for the first verification pass. The example below uses Codex because `verify-install` then checks the real installed bundle in its native host path.

```bash
npx @orchid-labs/pluxx init \
  --from-mcp https://example.com/mcp \
  --yes \
  --name acme \
  --display-name "Acme" \
  --author "Acme" \
  --targets claude-code,cursor,codex,opencode \
  --grouping workflow \
  --hooks safe

cd acme
npx @orchid-labs/pluxx doctor
npx @orchid-labs/pluxx lint
npx @orchid-labs/pluxx build --install --trust
npx @orchid-labs/pluxx verify-install --target codex
```

Expected output checkpoints:

- `init`
  - writes `pluxx.config.ts`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `skills/`, and `.pluxx/mcp.json`
- `doctor`
  - should report no errors
  - may emit warnings for trust, host caveats, or runtime/auth assumptions that still need action
- `lint`
  - should exit cleanly
- `build --install --trust`
  - should write `dist/claude-code`, `dist/cursor`, `dist/codex`, and `dist/opencode`
  - should install or relink the local host bundles
- `verify-install --target codex`
  - should end with `pluxx verify-install passed.`

Swap `codex` for `claude-code`, `cursor`, or `opencode` if that is your real first host.

## Fast Troubleshooting

- Auth failure during `init`
  - rerun `init --from-mcp` with explicit auth flags such as `--auth-env ... --auth-type bearer` or `--auth-type header --auth-header ... --auth-template '${value}'`
  - for OAuth-first MCPs, use `--auth-type platform --runtime-auth platform`, or `--oauth-wrapper` when the handshake needs a local browser-assisted wrapper
- Runtime path problems on local stdio MCPs
  - pass the real executable command, not just the package name
  - if the runtime lives under a local path such as `./build/index.js`, rerun `doctor` and make sure the inferred `passthrough` payload is present
- Installed plugin does not appear in the host
  - `build --install` already runs the install step for this first-run path
  - reload the host after install:
    - Claude Code: `/reload-plugins`
    - Cursor: reload the window or restart Cursor
    - Codex: `Plugins > Refresh` if available, otherwise restart Codex
    - OpenCode: reload or restart OpenCode
  - rerun `verify-install --target <host>`
- Permissions or trust warnings
  - if the plugin contains local hook commands, install with `--trust`
  - if the installed state still looks wrong, run `pluxx doctor --consumer <installed-path>`

## Validation Checklist

- Run the canonical path against at least one real remote MCP example.
- Run it against at least one local stdio MCP example.
- Confirm the same command order appears in `README.md`, this doc, and the docs site getting-started page.
- Confirm at least one host install still ends with `pluxx verify-install passed.`
- Recheck the troubleshooting block after lifecycle or auth behavior changes.

## The Story In One Screen

```text
raw MCP or host-native plugin
        ->
one maintained Pluxx source project
        ->
native Claude / Cursor / Codex / OpenCode bundles
        ->
install in the host you actually use
        ->
verify the installed bundle instead of trusting dist alone
```

## Fastest Proof Path

If you want the shortest credible answer to "is this real yet?", use this order:

1. [Self-hosted core-four proof](./pluxx-self-hosted-core-four-proof.md)
   What it proves: one maintained `example/pluxx` source project builds, installs, and passes `verify-install` across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode.

2. [Docs Ops core-four proof](./docs-ops-core-four-proof.md)
   What it proves: the flagship `example/docs-ops` source project builds, installs, passes `verify-install`, and completes read-only inspect/rewrite workflows through the official Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode CLIs.

3. [Docs Ops live Codex walkthrough](./orchid-docs-ops-codex-walkthrough.md)
   What it proves: one maintained `docs-ops` source project compiles into a real in-app Codex plugin and talks to Orchid's live Docsalot MCP.

4. [Docs Ops authenticated publish path](./docs-ops-authenticated-publish-path.md)
   What it proves: the flagship example no longer treats Orchid's public MCP endpoint as a publish surface; the private write lane is separately modeled, install/runtime-configurable, and mechanically guarded.

5. [Orchid Accordion before/after rewrite](../example/docs-ops/demo-rewrites/orchid-components-accordion.after.md)
   What it proves: the flagship example produces user-visible output, not just config files.

6. [Exa Research Example](./exa-research-example.md)
   What it proves: Exa-style research workflows can ship natively across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode from one maintained source project, while keeping bundled MCP wiring, specialist agents, and host-native install surfaces.

7. [Docs-ingestion scaffold before/after demo](./strategy/docs-ingestion-scaffold-before-after.md)
   What it proves: Firecrawl-backed sourced context changes the real generated scaffold, not just an eval row.

8. [Core-four provider docs audit](./core-four-provider-docs-audit.md)
   What it proves: the compatibility story is grounded in first-party provider docs, not hand-waving.

## Public Proof Panels

If you need the public story in the fewest moving parts, use these four proof panels:

| Panel | Read this | Supported claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Self-hosted core four | [pluxx-self-hosted-core-four-proof](./pluxx-self-hosted-core-four-proof.md) | one maintained source project can build, install, and verify across the core four |
| Flagship read-only workflow | [docs-ops-core-four-proof](./docs-ops-core-four-proof.md) | the flagship example is real across the official CLIs, not just one host |
| Flagship authenticated publish split | [docs-ops-authenticated-publish-path](./docs-ops-authenticated-publish-path.md) | read-only Orchid access is not being mislabeled as a publish path |
| Exa distribution proof | [exa-research-example](./exa-research-example.md) | Exa-style research workflows can ship natively across the core four from one maintained source project |
| Docs-ingestion improvement | [docs-ingestion scaffold before/after](./strategy/docs-ingestion-scaffold-before-after.md) | sourced product/docs context materially improves the generated scaffold |

## Install The Released Pluxx Plugin

These commands install the released self-hosted `pluxx-plugin` from GitHub Releases.

### Claude Code

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/orchidautomation/pluxx-plugin/releases/latest/download/install-claude-code.sh | bash
```

Then run `/reload-plugins`.

### Cursor

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/orchidautomation/pluxx-plugin/releases/latest/download/install-cursor.sh | bash
```

Then reload the window or restart Cursor.

### Codex

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/orchidautomation/pluxx-plugin/releases/latest/download/install-codex.sh | bash
```

Then use `Plugins > Refresh` if available, otherwise restart Codex.

### OpenCode

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/orchidautomation/pluxx-plugin/releases/latest/download/install-opencode.sh | bash
```

Then reload or restart OpenCode.

For the fuller per-host install, update, and reload behavior, use [docs/core-four-install-update-lifecycle.md](./core-four-install-update-lifecycle.md).

Those follow-up notes are now backed by repo install-surface tests, not just walkthrough copy.

## Run Pluxx From Source

If you want to prove the product without installing the released self-hosted plugin first, use the source workflow directly:

```bash
npx @orchid-labs/pluxx init --from-mcp https://example.com/mcp --name my-plugin --yes

cd my-plugin
npx @orchid-labs/pluxx doctor
npx @orchid-labs/pluxx lint
npx @orchid-labs/pluxx build
npx @orchid-labs/pluxx install --target codex --trust
npx @orchid-labs/pluxx verify-install --target codex
```

Swap `codex` for `claude-code`, `cursor`, or `opencode` when you want to validate a different host.

If you installed the published CLI globally, the shortest lifecycle commands are:

```bash
pluxx --version
pluxx upgrade
```

`pluxx upgrade` upgrades the global npm install on your PATH. Repo-local `node ../../bin/pluxx.js ...` and `npx @orchid-labs/pluxx ...` flows stay separate.

## Install The Exa Example From Source

These installers build the public Exa example from the repo source and then install the native bundle into the selected host.

Important:

- the Exa example includes a local `sessionStart` hook: `scripts/check-exa-setup.sh`
- the hook only reports whether `EXA_API_KEY` is set and prints setup guidance
- the direct installers intentionally trust that hook on your behalf
- the equivalent source-path install command is `pluxx install --target <host> --trust`

### Claude Code

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orchidautomation/pluxx/main/example/exa-plugin/release/install-claude-code.sh | bash
```

### Cursor

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orchidautomation/pluxx/main/example/exa-plugin/release/install-cursor.sh | bash
```

### Codex

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orchidautomation/pluxx/main/example/exa-plugin/release/install-codex.sh | bash
```

### OpenCode

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orchidautomation/pluxx/main/example/exa-plugin/release/install-opencode.sh | bash
```

Current release note:

- the published npm package now includes the Claude plugin-agent manifest fix
- the public `pluxx test --install --trust --behavioral` path now matches the repo-local Exa proof state

## Best Demo Flow

Use this when you want a clean founder demo, customer walkthrough, or investor pass:

1. Start with [README](../README.md)
   Frame: one maintained plugin source project, four native destinations.

2. Show [Self-hosted core-four proof](./pluxx-self-hosted-core-four-proof.md)
   Frame: installed-state verification is real.

3. Show [Docs Ops core-four proof](./docs-ops-core-four-proof.md)
   Frame: the flagship example is mechanically real across the core four, not only inside one host.

4. Show [Docs Ops live Codex walkthrough](./orchid-docs-ops-codex-walkthrough.md)
   Frame: raw MCP is not enough; shaped workflows matter.

5. Show [Docs Ops authenticated publish path](./docs-ops-authenticated-publish-path.md)
   Frame: read-only public MCP access is not being passed off as write/publish support.

6. Show [Exa Research Example](./exa-research-example.md)
   Frame: Pluxx can take a Claude-first research-operator shape with specialist agents, rich branding, and command surfaces and compile it across the core four from one source.

7. Show the [Accordion before/after output](../example/docs-ops/demo-rewrites/orchid-components-accordion.after.md)
   Frame: the product changes user-visible output, not only internals.

8. Show [Docs-ingestion scaffold before/after demo](./strategy/docs-ingestion-scaffold-before-after.md)
   Frame: sourced product/docs context materially improves the scaffold.

9. Close with [Core-four provider docs audit](./core-four-provider-docs-audit.md)
   Frame: the compatibility story is truthful and provider-backed.

## What This Page Does Not Claim

This page is intentionally narrow.

It does not claim:

- the website is already the strongest public surface
- every host already has equally polished in-app flagship proof yet
- Orchid authenticated publish is already proven end to end
- the trust/distribution layer is already the main product

It does claim:

- the core product thesis is now backed by real repo-native proof
- the released self-hosted plugin has one-command install paths
- the current strongest demos can be followed without digging through maintainer notes
